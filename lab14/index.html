  		<h2><span>Problems</span></h2>
  			<p><br>Problems we encountered while we were doing the lab included many. First we had issues finding the right placement,
        putting text in the right place was pretty difficult to find. We also had issues with the buttons but after many attempts we figured it out. We also had issues with the different color text
        but we figured it out.<br></p>

    <div class="text">
  		<h2><span>Results</span></h2>
  		<p>Our results gave us more experince on how hard it is to bulit a website but fun at the same time. <br><br></p>
