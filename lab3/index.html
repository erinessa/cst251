	<h1>Lab 3: File Stuctures</h1>
		<p>The big idea for this lab was to work with a partner to
			create a local file structure on our computer and add index.html files.</p>

	<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>A challenge that we ran into was how to organize our files well. After
			that, the assignment went pretty smooth. We solved and were able to work
			through most of our problems. After that we had one other problem,  when
			we ran index.html square symbols showed up above our links. We cross
			referenced our codes but found no significant differences.</p>

	<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>The results for this lab gave us more insight on how we can use structures
			to further develop our websites. We were able to add images, create lists,
			and add links. However, we were not able to solve our only problem. Below
			are screenshots of our file structures:</p>
