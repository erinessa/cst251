  		<h2><span>Challenge</span></h2>
  			<p>The challenge for this lab was to work with a partner and experiment with CSS Selectors.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="text">
  		<h2><span>Difficulties</span></h2>
  			<p>We had a bit of difficulty understanding the lab. We got stuck trying to style more than
          one element at a time. We worked through each task<br>
  			and were succesful in the end. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="text">
  		<h2><span>Results</span></h2>
  		<p>The result of our work gave us more insight on how to use selectors to style our own html website.</p>
